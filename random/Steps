Suggestions for the first homework
*****************************************

1- Define heuristic function
	* Number of queens of each player a=10
	* Number of pieces of each player b=5
	* Distance to the end of each player (only a few pieces?) c=0.001
	* ¿Pieces in danger?
2- Programme mini-max
3- Programme mini-max with alpha-beta
4- Variable depth
	* Initial depth of X
	* Each Y games the depth increases in 1
5- Check repeted states
	* Define a good hash function
	* Not sure if this will help...
	* ¿Maybe check both the state and the depth?
		-The some state with differents depths could have different value.
	* Check simetrical games too!!!!
